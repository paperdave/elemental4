# This file serves as the "format guide/example" for elements, as it's not
# the same as the one in Elemental 2
#
# Some key things to note:
#  - You can use multiple spaces to separate things to make it line up.
#  - Add comments by placing # at a start of a line.
#  - You can redefine colors and elements which will have no effect.
