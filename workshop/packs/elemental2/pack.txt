# Elemental 2 Raw Data by Cary Huang... in the Elemental Lite format
#
# This file also serves as the "format guide/example" for elements, as
# it's not the same as the one in Elemental 2. This file does not describe
# the entire format either.
#
# Some key things to note:
#  - You can use multiple spaces to separate things to make it line up.
#  - Add comments by placing # at a start of a line.
#  - You can redefine colors and elements which will have no effect.
